## Command Line Zombie Survival | Patrycja Bachleda

### Summary
##### A command line program that displays a grid with obstacles and "monsters" and allows the player to navigate to get to the objective. The "monsters" are programmed to catch the player using Bread-First algorithm to take the shortest path.
### Objective
#### This project was completed as the final to Data Structures and Algorithms class and specifically focused on path finding algorithms.

#### This repository provides essentials for this program such as the grid layout. To run, using a gcc compiler:
  ```
  hw6extra3.c -o hw6extra3     (this creates an executable file to run)
  hw6extra3 hw6extra3in1.txt    (the program takes in an input which contains the grid, 1-5 are provided)
  ```
